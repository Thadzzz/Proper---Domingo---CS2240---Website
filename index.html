      <div class="neoclassicism-is-somewhat">
        Neoclassicism is somewhat a descendant of the classical era and is a
        resurrection of numerous aesthetics from the classical period. The era’s
        rise could be seen starting around the mid 18th century.
      </div>
      <div class="the-movement-was-container">
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">
          The Movement was encouraged by Johann Winckelmann, a German
          archaeologist and art historian whose writings revived interest in
          classical art among the general public and had a key role in inspiring
          the Neoclassical movement in the arts.
        </p>
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">
          For example, He wrote a book named which was named “Reflections on the
          Painting and Sculptures of the Greeks” containing the Greek ideal in
          education and arts.
        </p>
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">
          Another one was named “History of the Art of Antiquity” which
          contained descriptions of ancient arts. Including ones such as the
          classical era.
        </p>
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="the-neoclassic-period">
          Both texts are a few examples of how Johann’s writings were able to
          increase the Neoclassic art movement’s popularity. And inspire others
          to go along with it.

          Antonio was an artist that greatly praised mythological subjects,

          Moreover, he developed interest in sculpting at a very young age due
          to his father’s occupation (Stone mason, Sculptor, owned a Marble
          quarry). He was also one of the many artists that was inspired by
          Johann Winkelmann’s writings.

          For its art characteristics, Neoclassicism favored usage of symmetry,

          artworks. Moreover, attributes such as being Serious, Virtuous,
          Orderly, Heroic, and Classical subject matter were also common within
          these artworks. And the medium for such things usually were Paintings,
          Sculptures, and Architecture. But of course, they were not limited to
          these.
